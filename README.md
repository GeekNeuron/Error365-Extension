# Error365 - Your Personal Web Error Dictionary

Error365 is a lightweight and intuitive browser extension that acts as your personal guide to the cryptic world of web errors. Instead of copy-pasting codes like `net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` into a search engine, Error365 instantly detects the error and shows you a simple, human-readable explanation directly in your browser.

Designed with a clean, minimalist, dark-only interface, it helps users and developers alike to quickly diagnose and understand issues, saving time and frustration.
